Cook Me A Squid
==========
A simple cooking webapplication.

#### Initial application
This is the Ruby declination of a school project written in J2EE: [Cook Me A Poney](https://github.com/Aryess/cookMeAPoney).
[Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_Yje6hJA24NckVna255NUNnaTA/edit?usp=sharing)[fr] from [J.Saraydaryan](http://fr.linkedin.com/pub/jacques-saraydaryan/41/b00/634)

This application is my initiative to push the project a bit further, and to pratice my Rails knowledge.

##Using the app
####Easy way
The application is available online [here](http://cookmeasquid.herokuapp.com/) thanks to Heroku

#### Custom install
If you want to use it on your own webserver, just clone the repo and set up the database
Then start the server and you're ready to go!
